# Project_1_Cryphy

Cryphy is a crypto monitoring website that provides visual feedback based on market change. We used the Bulma framework for the HTML and CSS. Jquery was used in the Javascript as well. As for APIs the CoinLore API was used to pull ticker information like price and market change over differnt time frames about the top 100 traded coins. Once the user selects the coin they are interested in and the time of market change they want to know that information is used in the giphy API to return a gif based on the selected market change.
